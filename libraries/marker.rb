  #Regarding marker files:
  #
  #The idea here is you have a simple "signal" on disk that tells you when you've
  #successfully run something, and you don't want to run it again if you don't have to.
  #
  #Also, the decision to rerun a unit of work becomes explicit - and owned by you.
  #(it's not based on trusting a target program to respond in some way).
  #You don't have to learn and keep up this "re-run" logic per unit of work / program
  #
  #Also, simply ls'ing the marker dir gives you interesting information all in once place -
  #i.e. what markers are there and what are their timestamps?
  #
  #And reinstalls are easy - just rm the relevant marker file.
